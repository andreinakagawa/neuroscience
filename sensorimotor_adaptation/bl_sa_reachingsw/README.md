#Sensorimotor adaptation software developed with Qt

- developed by: Andrei Nakagawa, MSc
- contact: nakagawa.andrei@gmail.com

Description: This software can be used for visuomotor adaptation tasks.
Mouse displacement is used as the input for the software.
For now, the experiment protocol is solely defined in the source code (ProtocolController class).
Future works: Create protocols dynamically and save them in text files to be loaded before the experiment.
